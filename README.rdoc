= Fuzzy Hash

This is useful when you want to have a lookup table that can either contain strings or regexes.
For instance, you might want a catch all for certain regexes that perform a certain logic.

  >> hash = FuzzyHash.new
  >> hash[/^\d+$/] = 'number'
  >> hash[/.*/] = 'something'
  >> hash['chunky'] = 'bacon'
  >> hash['foo'] = 'vader'
  
  >> hash['foo']
  << 'vader'
  >> hash['food']
  << 'something'
  >> hash['123']
  << 'number'
